	abstract = {Image registration is a fundamental issue in multispectral image processing. In filter wheel based multispectral imaging systems, the non-coplanar placement of the filters always causes the misalignment of multiple channel images. The selective characteristic of spectral response in multispectral imaging raises two challenges to image registration. First, the intensity levels of a local region may be different in individual channel images. Second, the local intensity may vary rapidly in some channel images while keeps stationary in others. Conventional multimodal measures, such as mutual information, correlation coefficient, and correlation ratio, can register images with different regional intensity levels, but will fail in the circumstance of severe local intensity variation. In this paper, a new measure, namely normalized total gradient (NTG), is proposed for multispectral image registration. The NTG is applied on the difference between two channel images. This measure is based on the key assumption (observation) that the gradient of difference image between two aligned channel images is sparser than that between two misaligned ones. A registration framework, which incorporates image pyramid and global/local optimization, is further introduced for rigid transform. Experimental results validate that the proposed method is effective for multispectral image registration and performs better than conventional methods.},

	abstract = {Accurate definition of the similarity measure is a key component in image registration. Most commonly used intensity-based similarity measures rely on the assumptions of independence and stationarity of the intensities from pixel to pixel. Such measures cannot capture the complex interactions among the pixel intensities, and often result in less satisfactory registration performances, especially in the presence of spatially-varying intensity distortions. We propose a novel similarity measure that accounts for intensity nonstationarities and complex spatially-varying intensity distortions in mono-modal settings. We derive the similarity measure by analytically solving for the intensity correction field and its adaptive regularization. The final measure can be interpreted as one that favors a registration with minimum compression complexity of the residual image between the two registered images. One of the key advantages of the new similarity measure is its simplicity in terms of both computational complexity and implementation. This measure produces accurate registration results on both artificial and real-world problems that we have tested, and outperforms other state-of-the-art similarity measures in these cases.},
