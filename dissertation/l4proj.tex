%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    Every abstract follows a similar pattern. Motivate; set aims; describe work; explain results.
    \vskip 0.5em
    ``XYZ is bad. This project investigated ABC to determine if it was better. 
    ABC used XXX and YYY to implement ZZZ. This is particularly interesting as XXX and YYY have
    never been used together. It was found that  
    ABC was 20\% better than XYZ, though it caused rabies in half of subjects.''

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 20 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.
%
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
%
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.

Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?
\section{Guidance}

\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly. 

\section{Writing guidance}
\subsection{Who is the reader?}

This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
    \item
    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
    \item
    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
    \item
    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
    \emph{explain your project}.
    \item
    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
    strive for accuracy.}
    \item
    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
    irrelevant}.
\end{itemize}

Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

\subsection{References and style guides}
There are many style guides on good English writing. You don't need to
read these, but they will improve how you write.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    \emph{How to write a great research paper} \cite{Pey17} (\textbf{recommended}, even though you aren't writing a research paper)
    \item
    \emph{How to Write with Style} \cite{Von80}. Short and easy to read. Available online.
    \item
    \emph{Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace} \cite{Wil09} A very popular modern English style guide.
    \item
    \emph{Politics and the English Language} \cite{Orw68}  A famous essay on effective, clear writing in English.
    \item
    \emph{The Elements of Style} \cite{StrWhi07} Outdated, and American, but a classic.
    \item
    \emph{The Sense of Style} \cite{Pin15} Excellent, though quite in-depth.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Citation styles}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
\item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Plagiarism warning}

\begin{highlight_title}{WARNING}
    
    If you include material from other sources without full and correct attribution, you are commiting plagiarism. The penalties for plagiarism are severe.
    Quote any included text and cite it correctly. Cite all images, figures, etc. clearly in the caption of the figure.
\end{highlight_title}


%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Background}
What did other people do, and how is it relevant to what you want to do?
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item
      Don't give a laundry list of references.
    \item
      Tie everything you say to your problem.
    \item
      Present an argument.
    \item Think critically; weigh up the contribution of the background and put it in context.    
    \item
      \textbf{Don't write a tutorial}; provide background and cite
      references for further information.
\end{itemize}

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Analysis/Requirements}
What is the problem that you want to solve, and how did you arrive at it?
\section{Guidance}
Make it clear how you derived the constrained form of your problem via a clear and logical process. 

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Design}
How is this problem to be approached, without reference to specific implementation details? 
\section{Guidance}
Design should cover the abstract design in such a way that someone else might be able to do what you did, but with a different language or library or tool.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Implementation}
What did you do to implement this idea, and what technical achievements did you make?
\section{Guidance}
You can't talk about everything. Cover the high level first, then cover important, relevant or impressive details.



\section{General points}

These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.



\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:relu} 
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/synthetic.png}
        \caption{Synthetic image, black on white.}
        \label{fig:syn1}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad, \hfill etc. 
      %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/synthetic_2.png}
        \caption{Synthetic image, white on black.}
        \label{fig:syn2}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad, \hfill etc. 
    %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)    
    \caption{Synthetic test images for edge detection algorithms. \subref{fig:syn1} shows various gray levels that require an adaptive algorithm. \subref{fig:syn2}
    shows more challenging edge detection tests that have crossing lines. Fusing these into full segments typically requires algorithms like the Hough transform.
    This is an example of using subfigures, with \texttt{subref}s in the caption.
    }\label{fig:synthetic}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }
    
\caption{The Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm for drawing samples from arbitrary probability distributions, 
specialised for normal proposal distributions $q(x^\prime|x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$. The symmetry of the normal distribution means the acceptance rule takes the simplified form.}\label{alg:metropolis}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise. 

\begin{table}[]
    \caption{The standard table of operators in Python, along with their functional equivalents from the \texttt{operator} package. Note that table
    captions go above the table, not below. Do not add additional rules/lines to tables. }\label{tab:operators}

\subsection{Code}

Avoid putting large blocks of code in the report (more than a page in one block, for example). Use syntax highlighting if possible, as in Listing \ref{lst:callahan}.

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{images/boxplot_finger_distance.pdf}    

    \caption{Average number of fingers detected by the touch sensor at different heights above the surface, averaged over all gestures. Dashed lines indicate
    the true number of fingers present. The Box plots include bootstrapped uncertainty notches for the median. It is clear that the device is biased toward 
    undercounting fingers, particularly at higher $z$ distances.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
