      # in some cases you will want to run your job on a node with a specific type of

      # tell the Kubernetes scheduler that this job must be scheduled on a node
      # where the value of the "node-role.ida/gpu2080ti" annotation is true, i.e. on
      # a node with RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. To do the equivalent for the RTX Titan nodes,
