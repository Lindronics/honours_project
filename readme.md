## Deep neural network for classification of multispectral images

### Description

The goal of this project will be to develop a CNN-based model for classification of multispectral data consisting of visible light and thermal images.

The desired application is pedestrian detection at day- and nighttime. An Android mobile application for real-time application of the developed model is an optional step for the second half of the project.
