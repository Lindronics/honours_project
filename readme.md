## Deep neural networks for classification of hyperspectral images

### Description

Deep convolutional neural networks have been achieving impressive results on image classification tasks (http://deeplearning.net/ ). The application area will be to classify animal types in outdoor settings. This project will develop image classification systems using such machine learning techniques. Python libraries for the neural networks are available to use. 

The system can be tested initially on conventional image collections, but a FLIRone camera with combined visible light and infrared sensors will be available to acquire night-time images. 

Students wishing to gain mobile development experience can implement a system on a mobile device with the added sensors.
